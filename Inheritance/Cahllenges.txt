Great progress! Here are some challenges to reinforce your understanding:

1️⃣ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
Challenge:
Create a Person class with name and an Address object. Implement both shallow copy and deep copy for the Person class using cloning.

Requirements:

Implement shallow copy using clone().
Implement deep copy using copy constructor or by overriding clone() properly.
2️⃣ Inheritance & Method Overriding
Challenge:
Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound().
Derive two classes: Dog and Cat, and override makeSound() to print "Bark" and "Meow", respectively.

Bonus: Add a speakTwice() method in Animal that calls makeSound() twice. Observe how method overriding works.

3️⃣ Constructor Chaining
Challenge:
Create a class hierarchy:
Vehicle (superclass) → Car (subclass) → ElectricCar (subclass of Car).

Ensure constructor chaining happens properly from Vehicle → Car → ElectricCar.

Requirements:

Vehicle should have a brand property.
Car should add a model property.
ElectricCar should add a batteryCapacity.
Call the parent class constructor using super() in each subclass.
4️⃣ Using this and super
Challenge:
Create a Student class with:

A constructor that initializes name and age.
A method printDetails() that prints student info.
A display() method that calls printDetails() using this.
Create a subclass GraduateStudent that adds a degree field and overrides printDetails(), using super.printDetails() to reuse code from Student.
