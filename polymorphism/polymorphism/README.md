- **Database:** MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 📚 My Learning Journey
I am currently deep-diving into Java and focusing on understanding and implementing OOP concepts. Here are some key areas I'm exploring:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
- **Polymorphism:** Exploring how methods can take many forms through method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstract Classes and Methods:** Understanding how to define abstract classes and methods to enforce a contract in subclasses.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The two types of polymorphism are:
1. **Compile-time (or Static) Polymorphism:** Achieved through method overloading.
2. **Runtime (or Dynamic) Polymorphism:** Achieved through method overriding.
