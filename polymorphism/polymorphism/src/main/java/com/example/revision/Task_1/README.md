Task 1: Overloading with Copy Constructors
Challenge: Create a Book class with fields String title and int pages. 
Implement:
A default constructor.
A parameterized constructor (title, pages).
Two overloaded copy constructors: one taking a Book (shallow copy) and another taking a Book and a String newTitle (shallow copy with title override).
Test in a Main class by creating an original, a shallow copy, and a copy with a new title.
Goal: Practice overloading with copy constructors.
