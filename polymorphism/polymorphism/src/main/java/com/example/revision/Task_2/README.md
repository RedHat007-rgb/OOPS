Task 2: Overriding in an Inheritance Hierarchy
Challenge: Define a Shape class with a method draw(). Create Circle and Rectangle subclasses that inherit from Shape and override draw().
Add a String[] attributes field to Shape. Implement a deep copy constructor in Circle.
Test by creating a Circle, deep copying it, modifying the copyâ€™s attributes, and drawing both.
Goal: Combine inheritance, overriding, and deep copying.
