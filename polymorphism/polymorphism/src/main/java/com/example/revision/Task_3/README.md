Task 3: Polymorphism with Arrays
Challenge: Create a Vehicle class with String brand and a method start(). 
Create Car and Bike subclasses that override start(). 
In a Main class, make an array of Vehicle containing a Car and a Bike. Call start() on each. 
Add a shallow copy constructor to Car and test it separately.
Goal: Explore runtime polymorphism and integrate shallow copying.
