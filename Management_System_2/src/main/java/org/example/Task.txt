Real-World Mini-Project: Library Management System
This project combines polymorphism, inheritance, and copy constructors into a practical,
showcase-worthy application.
Project Description:
Build a simple library system to manage books and media items, demonstrating all your skills.
Requirements
Base Class: LibraryItem
Fields: String title, int id, boolean isBorrowed.
Method: displayInfo() (to be overridden).
Shallow copy constructor.


Subclasses:
Book (extends LibraryItem):
Additional field: int pages.
Overridden displayInfo(): "Book: [title], ID: [id], Pages: [pages], Borrowed: [isBorrowed]".
Deep copy constructor (duplicate all fields).
DVD (extends LibraryItem):
Additional field: int duration (in minutes).
Overridden displayInfo(): "DVD: [title], ID: [id], Duration: [duration] mins, Borrowed: [isBorrowed]".
Shallow copy constructor.
Utility Class: LibraryManager
Method: addItem(LibraryItem item) (overloaded for Book and DVD with specific messages).
Method: displayAllItems(LibraryItem[] items) (uses polymorphism).
Main Class
Create a Book and a DVD.
Make a deep copy of the Book and a shallow copy of the DVD.
Modify the copies (e.g., borrow the copied Book, change the DVD title).
Store all items in a LibraryItem[] array and display them.
